Marray: Fast Runtime-Flexible Multi-dimensional Arrays and Views in C++

Copyright (c) 2013 by Bjoern Andres, bjoern@andres.sc


Short Description

Marray is a single header file for fast multi-dimensional arrays and views 
in C++. Unlike in other implementations such as boost MultiArray and 
Blitz++, the dimension of Marray views and arrays can be set and changed at 
runtime. Dimension is not a template parameter in Marray. Arrays and views 
that have the same type of entries but different dimension are therefore of 
the same C++ type. In conjunction with the comprehensive and 
convenient Marray interface, this brings some of the flexibility known from 
high-level languages such as Python, R and MATLAB to C++.


Features

- Multi-dimensional arrays and views whose dimension, shape, size and
  indexing order (first or last coordinate major order) can be set and
  changed at runtime
- Access to entries via coordinates, initializer lists, scalar indices and
  STL-compliant random access iterators
- Arithmetic operators with type promotion and expression templates
- Support for STL-compliant allocators
- MIT License for worry-free use and distribution


Tutorial

- An introductory tutorial can be found at src/tutorial/tutorial.cxx


Installation

Marray is a single header file, marray.hxx, that can be used without compiling
or installing libraries. In addition, the Marray repository contains a 
tutorial, a unit test and a configuration file for CMake 2.6 (or higher) to
simplify the process of building the tutorial, unit test and reference 
documentation.
